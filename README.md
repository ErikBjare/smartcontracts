Erik's Ethereum Contracts
=========================

I've written Solidity on and off since 2015 but haven't uploaded (or even saved, sadly) much of what I've produced. So here is a repository for you to enjoy.

**WARNING:** Bugs in smart contracts can lead to financial loss. I haven't done any significant testing on these contracts, so never deploy one of them on the main net.

# Contracts

All contracts are in `src/contracts`:

 - erc20.sol
 - old/predictionmarket.sol
 - old/ballot.sol
